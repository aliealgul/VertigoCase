#VERTIGO GAMES CASE STUDY

**Software Versions**

Unity 2020.3.21f1

Blender 3.2.0 Beta

Adobe Substance Painter 8.1.2



**Summary**

A map design which named “Shangai” based on fy_iceworld map layout, under 100k total polycount (around 95k).
All textures are at the size 4096x4096, except lightmaps.
“Resources” folder includes all “.blend” files.
All props modeled based on 1.80m tall male human referance model. Containers modeled based on [real world sizes](https://www.mrbox.co.uk/shipping-containers/#:~:text=Standard%20ISO%20shipping%20containers%20are,ft%20(2.89m)%20high.).



**Lore**

Vertigo Games Company has finished the development of their brand new game “Project X” and they are ready to publish it. But last night a group of terrorists has attacked to World’s largest shipping port located in Shangai, China. Now, it is time to save the copies of the project out of their hands.



**Why I picked Shangai?**

It is the largest shipping port according to [sources](https://www.worldshipping.org/top-50-ports). So I thought it will be the best option for the lore. Map doesn’t includes any props or features yet to make player feel like he/she is in China. 



**Area I struggle and which ways I follow to solve the problem**

First 2 days I create models properly to use LOD system in unity. After I finish modeling and texturing processes, I start to arrange lighting setup.
 
Then I came across lots of shading problems while baking lightmaps because of LOD. Then I bake lights with a non-proper way that I personally won’t use on projects. 

This time, everything is working but rearranging something in the scene is became a really time consuming process.

Then finally, since the map is relatively small and frame rates looks enough to me, I decide to keep going without LOD system.



**thanks to**

everyone in Vertigo Games for their time and feedbacks. I look forward to discuss with you.
Best regards...
